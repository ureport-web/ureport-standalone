# How to send test data to UReport
UReport offers various API for you to adjust your automation framework to send data.
There are two important collections you need to know about for you to send your data.
<br>
**Build and Test**
<P>Build is a collection that holds all your executions. It is named Build to reflect the build number your CI software generated when building your application and executing automation tests
<br> 
Test is a collection that holds all your tests that belongs to a specific build
<br>
Once you deploy the server, you can go to http://your-server:your-port/api-docs/
Or
You can log in with user admin and go to http://your-server:your-port/#/faq
