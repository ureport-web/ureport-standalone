    "ANSWER_API_LBL": "Please refer to our REST API documentation for more information.",
    "ANSWER_PL_1": "A product lane represents a conceptual combination of 8 pre-defined fields by UReport. Among these 8 fields, 2 are mandatory, and the other 6 are optional.<br> Let's use an example to explain it. <br> Say we have a web application that runs automation regression nightly. We need to run it in three different browsers. (Chrome, Firefox, and Safari).<br> We could have 3 potential product lanes in this scenario.",
    "ANSWER_PL_2": "All fields are free text, you can provide any suitable text for your organization. To make distinctions between each build, a build number must be provided through the payload <br> Once these product lanes are set, all future executions should keep pushing results under the same product lane with different build numbers from your CI software. <br> To know how to send data to the UReport server.",
    "QUESTION_AUTOANALYZE": "How does auto analyze work?",
    "ANSWER_AUTOANALYZE_1": "Auto analysis is one of the key feature UReport offers. User does not need to setup anything. it is on by default and cannot be turn off.<br> When user mark a fail test as an issue, if the marked test case failed in the future for the same reason, UReport will automatically mark the test as Investigated and indicate with the symbol <i class='fas fa-microscope c-investigated' ></i>.<br> UReport will search back, by default, 30 days for all investigated issues within the same Product and Automation Type. <br> This day number can be changed in the Settings.<hr> <br><strong>How does it work?</strong><br>When save failed test case through API, there are three fields user can provide: ",
    "ANSWER_AUTOANALYZE_2": "To allow the auto analysis to work. <u>error_message</u> must be provided. This is the field UReport uses during the auto analysis process.<br>To allow a more precise result, field <u>token</u> is recommended. Because a error message might contain dynamic value that varies from execution to execution. <br> <br> <u>What is token then? </u><br> A token is a string field that is totally up to the user to set. <br> Most commonly, if you are using any testing framework with a programming language, it won't be very hard to generate a string of number based on the line number of the failure from the stack trace. <br> Such sequential number can be used as your unique token. If the error message contains dynamic value such as date, providing the token will make the auto-analysis more accurate.<br><br><u> Note: UReport does not generate the token, it is up to the user to provide the value</u><br> <ul><li>When field <u>token</u> is present, <u>token</u> will be used for auto-analysis</li><li>When only field <u>error_message</u> is present, <u>error_message</u> will be used for auto-analysis</li><li>When only field <u>stack_trace</u> is present, <u>stack_trace</u> will be used for auto-analysis</li><li>The precedence of the fields is:  token > error_message > stack_trace </li><li>When all three fields are missing from a fail test, false will be return for all analysis.</li></ul>",
    "QUESTION_UID": "What is a UID from the test?",
    "ANSWER_UID": "UID stands for unique ID. It could be a number or string or the combination of both. The point is to have such unique ID mapped to each of the automated test. <br> To make the auto analysis work, UReport need to have a way to identify the uniqueness of each test, by providing a unique id when sending test run results to the UReport server, it will enable UReport to perform auto-analysis normally.<br> You will find this UID field everywhere when using API. <br> If your organization is using any testing management tool such as TestRail, PractiTest or HP ALM, you won't have trouble finding a unique number associated with any test you create. You can use this id to link with your automation run and then send this info to the UReport server.<br> Even if your organization does not use any test management tool, you can still assign some unique string or number to your automated tests. You just need to make sure they don't change after it is decided.",

Users can set the number of days in the system settings to control how long should the auto-analysis engine search back.</li> <li> An assigned test can be viewed by anyone, and the assignment of the same test will be carried to future runs until it is unassigned. The assignment will not show only when the test is either pass or mark as investigated.</li> <li> A pinned test case can only be viewed by the user who pins it. A pin will always be carried to future builds regardless of the status of the test until it is unpinned by the user.</li> ",

An outage will <strong>NOT</strong> be carried to future or past builds.</li>",

    "ANSWER_S_PLS_2": "And there is a product lane setting bind with product <u>UReport</u> and type <u>UI</u>, such setting will only apply to the builds from the first two product lane, because the third product lane has the automation type <u>API</u>",
    "QUESTION_S_IT": "What is Issue Type?",
